<h3> Some util functions for users who don't use any external CPP libraries like BOOST </h3>

The following functions are included as of now.

<ul>
<li> Split - Equivalent of Java split
<li> Combine - Opposite of split
<li> isFileExists - Checks for the existance of a file and return a bool.
</ul>

<h4> Enhancement lined up as of now </h4>

<ol>
<li> <u> Support the whole string based splitting : </u> 
         Though the split accepts string delim, it just assumes as if the string is a single character. Remove this restriction.
     
</ol>

<h4> Any enhancement/bug/pull requests welcome. </h4>
